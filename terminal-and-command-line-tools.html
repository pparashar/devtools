            <h2>Essential Terminal and CLI Tools for Developers</h2>
            <p>Terminal and command line tools are fundamental to a developer's toolkit, offering powerful ways to interact with systems, automate tasks, and streamline workflows. Here's an overview of some essential CLI tools:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Bash (Bourne Again Shell)</h3>
            <p>Bash is the default shell for most Unix-based systems, providing a rich set of commands for file manipulation, process management, and system administration.</p>
            
            <h3>2. PowerShell</h3>
            <p>Microsoft's PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework, popular among Windows developers for its object-oriented approach to scripting.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Git</h3>
            <p>While primarily a version control system, Git's CLI is crucial for managing code repositories, branching, merging, and collaborating with other developers.</p>
            
            <h3>4. SSH (Secure Shell)</h3>
            <p>SSH allows secure remote access to systems, essential for managing servers and remote development environments.</p>
            
            <h3>5. Vim/Emacs</h3>
            <p>These powerful text editors operate entirely from the command line, offering extensive customization and efficiency for text manipulation tasks.</p>
