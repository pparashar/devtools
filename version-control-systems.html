            <h2>Understanding Version Control Systems (VCS)</h2>
            <p>Version Control Systems are essential tools for developers, enabling them to track changes in their codebase, collaborate with team members, and manage different versions of their projects efficiently.</p>
            
            <h3>1. Git</h3>
            <p>Git is the most widely used distributed version control system. It offers powerful branching and merging capabilities, making it ideal for both small and large-scale projects.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Subversion (SVN)</h3>
            <p>SVN is a centralized version control system that's still popular in some enterprise environments. It provides a simpler model for version control compared to Git.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Mercurial</h3>
            <p>Mercurial is another distributed version control system known for its simplicity and ease of use, while still offering powerful features for managing code repositories.</p>
